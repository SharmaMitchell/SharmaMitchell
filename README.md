### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitchell Sharma, a Software Engineer based in Houston, TX. I'm currently studying Computer Science at the University of Houston, graduating this December (2023).

I'm deeply interested in both front-end and back-end development, the latter of which I'm studying at university, and the former I've been self studying since late 2021. 

Outside of my studies, I've applied my development skills by creating websites for student organizations at my university, and (as of recently) contributing to an open source social media platform.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning NextJS and Firebase
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm fluent in Japanese! I self studied for 4 years, and worked part-time as an English/Japanese tutor for 1.5 years.
