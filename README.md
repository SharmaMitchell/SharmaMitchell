### Greetings! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mitchell Sharma, a Software Engineer based in Houston, TX.

Outside of my work, I've applied my development skills by creating websites and Discord bots for student organizations at my university, developing Userscripts to improve websites I frequent, and contributing to an open source social media platform.  

Most of my side projects are completely open source - feel free to watch, fork, or contribute below!
